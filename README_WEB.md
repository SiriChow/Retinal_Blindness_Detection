## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/souravs17031999/Retinal_blindness_detection_Pytorch
   cd Retinal_blindness_detection_Pytorch
   ```

2. **Install web dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_web.txt
   ```

3. **Run the web application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

### With Pre-trained Model (Recommended)

To use the actual trained model for accurate predictions:

1. **Download the pre-trained model** (classifier.pt) - follow the original repository instructions
2. **Update the model path** in `app.py`:
   ```python
   model = initialize_model('path/to/your/classifier.pt')
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account with username and password
2. **Login**: Access your dashboard with your credentials
3. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or browse for a retinal image
4. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Image" to get AI predictions
5. **View Results**: See detailed classification and confidence scores
6. **History**: Check your prediction history anytime

### Supported Image Formats
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- BMP
- TIFF
- Maximum file size: 16MB

### Understanding Results

The system classifies retinal images into 5 categories:

| Class | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **No DR** | ‚úÖ Normal | No diabetic retinopathy detected |
| **Mild** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low Risk | Early signs, monitor regularly |
| **Moderate** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk | Moderate DR, requires attention |
| **Severe** | ‚ùå High Risk | Severe DR, needs medical care |
| **Proliferative DR** | ‚ùå Critical | Advanced DR, urgent treatment |

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Model**: PyTorch ResNet152
- **Database**: SQLite (for user management and history)
- **Image Processing**: PIL/Pillow for image handling

### Frontend
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with modern ES6+ features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medical Disclaimer
This system is designed for **educational and screening purposes only**. The AI predictions should **never replace professional medical diagnosis**. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for proper medical evaluation and treatment.

### üîí Privacy & Security
- User passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- Uploaded images are processed and immediately deleted
- Sessions are secure and expire appropriately
- No image data is permanently stored

### üöÄ Performance
- The ResNet152 model is computationally intensive
- Consider using GPU acceleration for better performance
- File uploads are limited to 16MB for reasonable processing times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found errors**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_web.txt
   ```

2. **Permission errors**:
   - Ensure the uploads directory is writable
   - Check file permissions on the project directory

3. **Model loading errors**:
   - Verify the model file path is correct
   - Ensure the model file is compatible with the PyTorch version

4. **Database errors**:
   - Delete `users.db` to reset the database
   - Check write permissions in the project directory

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for development:
```python
app.run(debug=True)
```
